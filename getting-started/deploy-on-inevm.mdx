1. [🚀Getting Started](/getting-started)

You can deploy your application onto inEVM via the same means as any Ethereum-compatible blockchain. For the purpose of example, we'll use the Caldera testnet chain RPC URL.

This section is non-exhaustive and serves to give a high-level overview of configuring a project to use inEVM. The exact process to deploy your smart contracts varies depending on the development tooling you're using. As a general rule, the process for deploying on and interacting with inEVM is the same as any EVM-compatible chain (including Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, etc.).

Updating the client-side to interact with inEVM is also done quickly: simply change the JSON-RPC Url used to that of inEVM. Note: ensure that all of your smart contracts are deployed on inEVM and that you have updated contract addresses on the frontend.
